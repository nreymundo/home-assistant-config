# [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nreymundo/home-assistant-config.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nreymundo/home-assistant-config) My Home Assistant config
The place where I store all the configs and scripts for my main home-assistant server. 

Nothing fancy currently and I'm using the default (old) states UI. Will probably put some images and a bettter README once I finally get around to implementing lovelace.
